This my first Pink Power Gym project ,using HTML , CSS , JavaScript.
Focusing on how can i style using margin & padding .
I used also hoover that makes project little dynamic , also i focused on alert  by using javaScript .
There is alittle idea here it is about a random customer reviews (when clicking on button it gives random reviews with their names).
In my project i was told to use adefinit tools like margin,padding,hoover,maxweidth,table.
I hope I could done my best :) .
